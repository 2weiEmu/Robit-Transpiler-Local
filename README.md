# Robit Transpiler Local
 Local Version of the Robit Transpiler.

# Installation
There are 2 installers present, which will / can help you with the install, but will probably not end up doing all of the work, and you will have to follow these steps:

1. Download the zip file from Github.
(If you want to contribute, feel free to do so, but I would rather that you first open an issue or deal with an existing issue, and explain how you would deal with this issue - in a, somewhat decent description, in the issue thread. I will then 'ok' the changes, and await in your implementation, on a fork. Which you can then ask to merge with this main repo.)


NO LONGER WORKS WITH UNDERSCORE VARIABLE NAMES - WILL BE FIXED SOME OTHER TIME!!!
