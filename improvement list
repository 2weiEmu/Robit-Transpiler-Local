TODOs
- Make the transpilation more efficient than a row of IF-Statements
- Multiple things (comma-seperated) in OUTPUT statements
- Make the diagnostics (debug things) that print to the console togglable
- Add the previously printed line as the prompt for the output to make it easier for a person to see 
    what information is requested.
- Add string concatenation
- Improve the order (and finding) of boolean operators in a string and splitting it based on that
    and based on the order of the operations
- Improve the number processing (especially for negative numbers, which it's having trouble with)
- Improve the string processing (e.g. something like "X's value is 5") is breaking

PREPROCESSING TO BE ADDED:
- Make the line checking more advanced so that it can even point out where in the line the error happened
- Add a Parse File that makes everything into tokens, and then we can make the thing into a tree
    so wecan seperate the tree building and correcting from the syntax correcting - partially to make
    that easier, and also more streamlined - and maybe also easier to convert to other languages.
- Make the Syntax Rules even Stricter -> e.g. nothing else should be on the same line as "ELSE"
- Check for indenting (correct amount of tabs)
- Check that all statements are complete and closed at some point.
