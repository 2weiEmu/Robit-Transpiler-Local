TODOs
- Make the transpilation more efficient than a row of IF-Statements
- Add a Parse File that makes everything into tokens, and then we can make the thing into a tree
    so wecan seperate the tree building and correcting from the syntax correcting - partially to make
    that easier, and also more streamlined - and maybe also easier to convert to other languages.

- Multiple things (comma-seperated) in OUTPUT statements
- Make the diagnostics (debug things) that print to the console togglable
- Add the previously printed line as the prompt for the output to make it easier for a person to see 
    what information is requested.
